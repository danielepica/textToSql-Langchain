# textToSql-Langchain
This project explores the integration of advanced language models (LLMs) with database management systems to 
enable users to formulate queries in natural language. 
The system translates natural language queries into SQL commands, queries the database, and returns the 
responses in natural language. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques are used to develop a pipeline
that handles SQL queries. Additionally, the system has been tested to generate Spark SQL queries
from natural language inputs. Furthermore, pre-defined agents from LangChain, such as the SQL
agent and Spark SQL agent, have been tested to evaluate the systemâ€™s performance and behavior. 
Although the system significantly improves data accessibility for non-technical users, making
database interaction more intuitive and effective, it encounters difficulties when handling complex
queries, which can compromise its effectiveness. Nonetheless, this project contributes to making
data more accessible, promoting data-driven decision-making across various sectors
